### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A lesson I learned in this assignment is that it is important to be very careful when inputting information in JavaScript because a small mistake can cause a project to not work, such as not capitalizing a letter in an addEventListener function.
2. The HTML document object model (DOM) allows JavaScript to access and alter all elements of an HTML document, which allows for dynamic and intuitive pages.
3. The document object allows for manipulation (change, delete, add) of and access to parts of an HTML document.
